# Charging: The battery is plugged in and actively charging (the battery percentage is increasing).
# Discharging: The laptop is running on battery power, and the battery is losing charge (the battery percentage is decreasing).
# Not charging: The laptop is plugged into a power source, but the battery is either already fully charged or the system is preventing it from charging to prolong battery life.
